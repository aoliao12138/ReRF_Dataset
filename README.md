### Description

We have uploaded 3 sample cases of data with different scenes (kpop, box and sing) and our compressed files of the scene kpop. The file structure is as follows:

- kpop.zip (contains 4000 frames)
  - image (Captured videos with white background)
    - 000.mp4 ([Camera index].mp4)
    - ...
    - 075.mp4
  - mask (Mask)
    - 000.mp4 ([Camera index].mp4)
    - ...
    - 075.mp4
  - bbox.json (the bounding box of the scene)
  - CamPose.inf (camera poses in the [NHR](https://github.com/wuminye/NHR) format)
  - Intrinsic.inf (camera intrinsics in the [NHR](https://github.com/wuminye/NHR) format)
- box.zip (contains 1000 frames)
- sing.zip (contains 800 frames)
- compressed_kpop.zip (compressed 4000 frames of the scene kpop)
